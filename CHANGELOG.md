- **Performance Testing**: Service restart times optimized, memory usage monitoring confirmed

### üìö Documentation
- **TESTING_REPORT.md**: Complete testing certification document
- **README.md**: Updated with production deployment instructions
- **Production Deployment Guide**: Docker commands and health check procedures

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Container Build Optimization**: Multi-stage Docker build with proper caching
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and user feedback
- **Code Organization**: Cleaned up duplicate components and unused files
- **Type Safety**: Improved JavaScript type checking and validation

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Playwright smoke tests and GitHub Actions E2E workflow (container boots, UI loads, basic API responds)
- React Router in the web UI; dev server proxy for /api; reliable data-testid hook for tests
- docs/DOCKERFILES.md to clarify canonical vs. deprecated Dockerfiles

### Changed
- Canonical API path: use Go config-service behind Nginx at /api (removed Node backend under web/backend)
- Standardized the Settings UI to the components/ implementation and removed legacy duplicates
- Deprecated Dockerfile.web to prevent confusion with the canonical Dockerfile
- Moved prototype/simple API scripts into scripts/legacy/

### Fixed
- Removed no-op code in config-service/main.go backup path handling

### Notes
- API key auth remains optional (disabled by default), per owner preference
- CORS remains permissive by default; consider a whitelist for production later
